# Handwritten Maths to LaTeX (Based on TAMER)

This repository focuses on **Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER)** — converting handwritten mathematical expressions into LaTeX code using deep learning.

The project is built upon the original **TAMER** framework (AAAI 2025), with additional personal experiments, modifications, and utilities developed for learning and research purposes.

## Overview

Handwritten mathematical expression recognition is a challenging task involving:

- Complex 2D symbol layouts  
- Variable handwriting styles  
- Large mathematical vocabularies  
- Structural ambiguity between symbols  

This repository explores adapting and extending the TAMER model for improved experimentation on custom datasets and workflows.
